# GitTipsAndTricks

###The progression of Source Control systems
1. Local SC (RCS) [image] (http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/book/01-introduction/images/local.png)
Slightly better than just dropping files in a folder and timestamping them.

2. Centralized SC (TFS) [image] (http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/book/01-introduction/images/centralized.png)
Single point of integration, single point of failure

3. Distributed SC (GIT) [image] (http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/book/01-introduction/images/distributed.png)
Fully fault tolerent, everyone has everything.

###GIT History
GIT grew out of the community involved with Linux Kernel Development.  Prior to GIT, the community had been using a commercial product, Bitkeeper, for its Source Control solution.  In 2005 the relationship with the company that owned Bitkeeper soured, and GIT was written as its replacement.

###GIT's goals

* Speed
* Simple design
* Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
* Fully distributed
* Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)
